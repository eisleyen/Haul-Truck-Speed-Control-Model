# Haul-Truck-Speed-Control-Model

This repository contains a Simulink model of a discrete closed-loop speed control system for an autonomous haul truck. The model is designed to regulate the truck's speed based on external factors while using a discrete PID controller for feedback-based control.

Features:
- Desired velocity calculated based on road grade and payload
- Desired velocity adjusted based on proximity to other haul truck (adaptive cruise control)
- Discrete PID controller for closed-loop velocity control.
- Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing within Simulink.
